# Image-Gallery
I have created this project using only "HTML" and intermediate level "CSS" 
"Pixel Heaven" is a minimalist image gallery project . Designed as a fun, skill-building exercise, the gallery showcases an elegant layout with responsive design principles. It features smooth image transitions and a clean, user-friendly interface, making it a visually appealing project while enhancing front-end development skills.
